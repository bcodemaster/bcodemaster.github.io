            <h4>Space Rocket</h4>
              <p>A java game developed in Eclipse using the Java canvas graphic interfaces. The game utilizes three object-oriented variables
                called game, Pipe and Jet. Game is the engine of the game, pipe creates random heights of pipes, and Jet the physics of the character
                while jumping and its sprites. It has two additional classes (renderable and Updatable) that are in charge of rendering and updating the
                objects in the games. Download Link: <a href="https://bcodemaster.github.io/SpaceRocket/index.html">bcodemaster.github.io/SpaceRocket</a </p>
            <h4>My Portfolio (Your Looking at it!)</h4>
              <p>Utilizing the latest standards of the mark up language HTML5 it also uses Cascading  Style Sheet or CSS to digitize my working experience
                through a world wide web. In simple words its my personal portfolio/resume made into a website. The purpose of the website is to demonstrate
                my knowledge in both HTML and CSS to any recruiter. The website was uploaded in GitHub at my username Bcodemaster and its on the following
